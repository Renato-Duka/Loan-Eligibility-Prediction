# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction
Developed a machine learning pipeline to predict loan approval outcomes using the Analytics Vidhya Loan Prediction dataset. Implemented end-to-end preprocessing (encoding, scaling, imputation), compared KNN, Naive Bayes, and SVM classifiers, performed single-feature analysis to identify Credit_History as the strongest predictor, and evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall to select the most effective approach.

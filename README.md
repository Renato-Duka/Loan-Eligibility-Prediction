# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction
Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict loan approval using the Analytics Vidhya dataset. I handled data preprocessing (encoding categorical features, scaling numerical variables, imputing missing values, and testing outlier clipping), then trained and compared KNN, Naive Bayes, and SVM models. I evaluated performance with confusion matrices, accuracy, precision, and recall, and ran a single-feature analysis that showed Credit_History was the strongest predictor. SVM provided the most balanced overall results.
